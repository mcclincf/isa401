This repository was created by Miami University students as a part of our ISA 401 class project. 

This project highlights Movie Performances in Box Office & IMDB from 2019 to 2022. 

This repository consists of a collection of three different R code files and 4 different CSV files. 
Here is a brief description of each: 

CODE -

Budgets --> this file scrapes budget data from the-numbers.com
Box Office --> this file scrapes box office data from the-numbers.com 
IMDB --> this file scrapes movie ratings and other data from imdb.com

CSV - 

Budgets --> this file contains the output from our Budgets code
Box Office --> this file contains the output from our Box Office code
IMDB --> this file contains the output from our IMDB code
Merged --> this file is a merged CSV file containing all of the data from the three previous csv files
